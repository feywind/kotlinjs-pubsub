# Kotlin-JS Pub/Sub example

### EXPERIMENTAL
This is a sample of how to use Cloud Pub/Sub from Kotlin-JS, using the
Node Pub/Sub libraries. It's basically just to see if I could, so please
do not base your product on this! :)

This is UNOFFICIAL and EXPERIMENTAL, and not recommended at this time.
_Caveat emptor!_

This will (probably) eventually become part of a blog post.
