# Kotlin-JS Pub/Sub example
## Licence: Apache 2.0

### EXPERIMENTAL
This is a sample of how to use Cloud Pub/Sub from Kotlin-JS, using the
Node Pub/Sub libraries. It's basically just to see if I could, so please
do not base your product on this! :)

This is UNOFFICIAL and EXPERIMENTAL, and not recommended at this time.
_Caveat emptor!_
